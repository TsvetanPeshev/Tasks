While the elephants are on the beach, they get very bored. Especially when their parents do not allow them to enter the water. To kill the boredom, they came up with the following game: Elephant Lonnie thinks of an integer positive. Then each of the other elephants also thinks of a number. Each elephant earns as many points as its divisor and Lonnie.The divisor does not count the unit, but the number itself can give the point of the elephant if it is a divisor of Loni's number and vice versa: the elephant will get a point if the number of Loni is a divisor of its number. The game was fun, but the elephants don't like to think, much less divide. Write a game program that, given a number devised by Loni and the numbers of the remaining elephants, determines the winners of the game.

Input
Two integers are entered on the first line of the standard input n- number of the elephants ans k - Loni's figure, the second line is entered n integers - the numbers imagined by elephants.
