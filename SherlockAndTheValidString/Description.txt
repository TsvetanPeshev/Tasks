It is also valid if he can remove just 1 character at 1  index in the string, and the remaining characters will occur the same number of times. Given a string , determine if it is valid. If so, return YES, otherwise return NO.For example s = abc, it is a valid string because frequencies are {a:1, b:1, c:1}.
