You know the horse Koci? He likes to iterate matrices.
Since he wants to be more than a regular horse, he iterates the matrices using the moves of the knights in chess as follows:
At each turn, he can jump to one of the 8 horse moves. He tries to jump to the topmost, leftmost cell of of these cells.
If all the 8 positions are taken (he already jumped there), he restarts him jumping from the leftmost, topmost free cell
At each turn he leaves a number, to indicate he has been there.
By given the size of the matrix, print the cells of Koci.
