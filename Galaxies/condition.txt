Given a matrix of 1s (stars) and 0s (empty space), calculate the size of each galaxy.
À galaxy is formed when each star is connected to another either vertically or horizontally. 
The size of a galaxy is the number of stars in it.
Input

On the first line - N M - dimensions of the matrix.
On the next N lines - each of the rows.
Output
Print to the standard output:
Sizes must be sorted in descending order.
Print the size of each galaxy on a new line.
Constraints
1 <= N, M <= 20
